Vue Framework 

- Software Framework that provides us with various abstractions that allow us to develop an interactive PWA 
- Up until now we have been working with standard, "Vanilla JS" ( plain ) 
- Allows us to quicken the dev process
- Seperate out logic for Model, View and Controller ( MVC )
- Best for larger projects with a reasonable lifespan
- Reactivity System makes it easy to establish two -way data binding between the model and the view
